<header>My favorite city</header>

<p>Besides the city where I was born, my favorite city in this world, in my opinion, is Riga.</p>

<h1>Riga - as my second hometown</h1>

 <p>I have learned Latvian as my major for 4 years. During my studies, I learned about the history, the culture and other aspects of Latvia and its capital city - Riga. Besides, to imrove my language skills, I have benn in Latvia 2 times - first time for attending the summer school organized by the University of Latvia, and the second time as an exchange student in RTU for one year.</p>

 <p>Although, compared to many cities in my motherland, the history of Riga is not as long as theirs, Riga attracted me by its mysterious stories of its establishment, the unique landscape of the OLD Riga, as well as the river "Daugava", which clears my heart whenever I walk by it.</p>

<h2>What I like of Riga</h2>
 <p>If someone wants to know more about Riga, Chinese would find information here: <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/里加/2710469?fr=aladdin">里加中文介绍</a></p>
 <p>And Wikipedia always tells them like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga">this</a>:</p>
 
 <p>Different from how goolge showes us, I felt cozy living in Riga, and I have several my own "symbols" of the city.</p>
   <ul>
     <li>"Nākamā pietura - Nacionālais teātris" on the bus: this is the most familiar sound for me in this city, because I heard it every workday in the morning</li>
     <li>Kaijas: 3 years ago when I first saw sea gulls in such a close sight, I can't belive that how big they are!!! And they are not afraid of people.</li>
     <li>Balta Ziema un Dzeltens Rundens: I enjoyed the gold leaves in Autunm as well as the snowwhite winter here.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>What I did every day in Riga</h3>
    <p>Mostly I was moving between the faculty and my dormistry every workday in Riga.</p>
       <ol>
        <li>got up before 7 and prepared breakfast</li>
        <li>Went to study at 8.00</li>
        <li>went back to buy some foods at Rimi and cook with my friends</li>
        <li>had fun walking on the beach by Daugava or chatting with roommates</li>
        <li>did some yoga and fell asleep</li>
       </ol>
